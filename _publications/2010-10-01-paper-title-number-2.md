excerpt: 'This work uses density functions for safe navigation in dynamic environments. The dynamic environment consists of time-varying obstacles as well as time-varying target sets. We propose an analytical construction of time-varying density functions to solve these navigation problems. The proposed approach leads to a time-varying feedback controller obtained as a positive gradient of the density function.'
