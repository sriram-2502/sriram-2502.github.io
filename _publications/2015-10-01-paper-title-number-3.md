excerpt: 'This paper presents the implementation of off-road navigation on legged robots using convex optimization through linear transfer operators. Given a traversability measure that captures the off-road environment, we lift the navigation problem into the density space using the Perron-Frobenius (P-F) operator. This allows the problem formulation to be represented as a convex optimization.'
