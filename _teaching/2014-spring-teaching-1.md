**Description**: This course provides an in-depth introduction to control systems engineering, focusing on modeling, analysis, and design techniques for linear feedback control systems. Topics include dynamic system modeling, system response analysis, stability, time-domain and frequency-domain design methods, and classical control techniques such as PID control. Students will gain hands-on experience with MATLAB/Simulink for system simulation and controller design, applying these skills to real world systems. By the end of the course, students will be able to design, analyze, and implement controllers to meet specified performance criteria in engineering applications. This is a required course in ME curriculum.

**Timeline**: This lesson plan should ideally occur in week 6 of the course. By this time, student should be exposed to the basics of modelling a system, Laplace transforms, representing systems as block diagrams, time domain analysis of the system, understanding stability and basics of feedback control.

Learning Obectives
======
1.	Identify the performance parameters for a control system: Students will identify different performance parameters that characterize a control system, such as rise time, settling time etc. (Bloom's level 1 and 2: Understanding and Remembering)
2.	Design a PID controller: Students will identify the basic components of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller and design one to control a simple system such as a spring-mass-damper system for desired performance characteristics. (Bloom's level 5: Creating)
3.	Analyze the system's response to different PID tuning: Students will simulate the system with the PID controller, analyzing the system's response and the effects of tuning the PID gains. (Bloom's level 4 and 5: Analyzing and Evaluating)
