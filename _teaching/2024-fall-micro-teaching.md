**Description**: I developed this micro teaching lesson incorporating active learning techniques as an introductory lecture to PID control. it provides students with hands-on experience with MATLAB/Simulink for system simulation and controller design. By the end of the course, students will be able to design, analyze, and implement a PID controller to meet specified performance criteria in engineering applications.

**Timeline**: This lesson plan should ideally occur in week 6 of the course. By this time, students should be exposed to the basics of modelling a system, Laplace transforms, representing systems as block diagrams, time domain analysis of the system, understanding stability and basics of feedback control.

Learning Obectives
======
1.	Identify the performance parameters for a control system: Students will identify different performance parameters that characterize a control system, such as rise time, settling time etc. (Bloom's level 1 and 2: Understanding and Remembering)
2.	Design a PID controller: Students will identify the basic components of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller and design one to control a simple system such as a spring-mass-damper system for desired performance characteristics. (Bloom's level 5: Creating)
3.	Analyze the system's response to different PID tuning: Students will simulate the system with the PID controller, analyzing the system's response and the effects of tuning the PID gains. (Bloom's level 4 and 5: Analyzing and Evaluating)
