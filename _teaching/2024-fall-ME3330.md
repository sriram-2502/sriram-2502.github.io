During my PhD, I served as the lead Teaching Assistant (TA) for **ME 3330**, a junior-level Mechanical Engineering lab focused on **data acquisition and control**. The lab is designed around **project-based learning**, featuring seven modules: filters, thermal sensors, accelerometers, strain gauges, fluids, HVAC systems, and heat exchangers.

In each lab session, I delivered a **mini-lecture** to introduce key concepts and objectives. Students began by building circuits using **NI myDAQ systems** and then progressed to developing virtual instruments (VIs) in LabVIEW for data acquisition and calibration. My responsibilities included guiding students through these steps, ensuring they selected appropriate sensors, and helping them meet the objectives of each module.

Beyond teaching, I was responsible for **grading assignments**, **developing semester schedules**, and **creating rubrics for new lab modules** to ensure consistent evaluation. I also contributed to **ABET accreditation efforts**, ensuring the course met educational standards. Additionally, I developed new lab modules and maintained existing ones, keeping the curriculum aligned with evolving industry practices.

This role allowed me to integrate theory with practice, enabling students to gain hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and techniques. It also enhanced my ability to manage course logistics, develop meaningful assessments, and foster an inclusive and engaging learning environment.


Student feedback
======
In Spring 2023, I had the privilege of working with two sections of ME 3330 as the lead TA. My feedback scores were higher than the university, departmental, and college averages, which I attribute to the collaborative and engaging atmosphere we built together. I genuinely enjoyed working with my students, helping them navigate the challenges of applying theoretical concepts to hands-on projects. Many students expressed appreciation for my clear communication, timely feedback, and approachability, which I deeply value as part of the teaching experience. These evaluations remind me of the importance of being both a guide and a learner, as I continuously strive to improve and support my students in meaningful ways.
