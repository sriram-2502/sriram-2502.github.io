HiðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m **Sriram Krishnamoorthy**, a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at **Clemson University**. My research focuses on **robotics and optimal control**, with a strong emphasis on data-driven methods for complex dynamic systems. 

Currently, Iâ€™m working on **data-driven control for quadruped locomotion over challenging terrains**, combining **trajectory optimization** using global planners with **model predictive control (MPC)** for precise and adaptive movements. I have also designed adaptive control algorithms for collaborative manipulation involving **multi-agent systems** for drones and ground robots.

## Recent Projects

Here are some of the exciting projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

- [**SE(3) Koopman-MPC**](https://github.com/sriram-2502/KoopmanMPC_Quadrotor): Developed a framework integrating the **Koopman operator** and MPC for data-driven control of **quadrotors** and **quadruped robots**.
- **Linear Time-Varying MPC**: Designed a [model predictive controller](https://github.com/AndrewZheng-1011/Quad_ConvexMPC) for **quadruped locomotion**, ensuring adaptability and efficiency in dynamic environments.
- **Density-Based Motion Planner**: Formulated a density function based [motion planner](https://github.com/sriram-2502/time_varying_density) for safe navigation of robotic systems.
- **Koopman Autoencoder**: Developed an [Deep Autoencoder](https://github.com/sriram-2502/Deep_Koopman_AutoEncoder) leveraging **Koopman operators** for learning-based control of complex nonlinear systems, such as quadruped robots.
