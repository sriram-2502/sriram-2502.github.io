## Recent Projects

Here are some of the exciting projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

- [**SE(3) Koopman-MPC**](https://github.com/sriram-2502/KoopmanMPC_Quadrotor): Developed a framework integrating the **Koopman operator** and MPC for data-driven control of quadrotors and quadruped robots.
- [**Linear Time-Varying MPC**](https://github.com/AndrewZheng-1011/Quad_ConvexMPC): Designed a LTV-MPC using rigid body dynamics for **agile locomotion**.
- [**Density-Based Motion Planner**](https://github.com/sriram-2502/time_varying_density): Formulated a density function based motion planner for **safe navigation** of robotic systems.
- [**Deep Koopman Autoencoder**](https://github.com/sriram-2502/Deep_Koopman_AutoEncoder): Developed an **Deep Autoencoder** leveraging Koopman operators for learning-based control of complex nonlinear systems, such as quadruped robots.

## Current Learning
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring **traversability mapping** for off-road navigation and developing a combining **Koopman MPC** for quadruped locomotion over challenging terrains.
