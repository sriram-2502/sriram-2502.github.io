HiðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m **Sriram Krishnamoorthy**, a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at **Clemson University**. My research focuses on **robotics and optimal control**, with a strong emphasis on data-driven methods for complex dynamic systems. 

Currently, Iâ€™m working on **data-driven control for quadruped locomotion over challenging terrains**, combining **trajectory optimization** using global planners with **model predictive control (MPC)** for precise and adaptive movements. I have also designed adaptive control algorithms for collaborative manipulation involving **multi-agent systems** for drones and ground robots.
